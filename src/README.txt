_default.js
===========
The default implementation of this module. E.g. if the feature "array" shall be 
included in a build and no special file is given the "_default.js" is used, because 
we assume the default behaviour (which mostly is WebKit-like, or another full featured 
implementation, with the least worries) is used.
